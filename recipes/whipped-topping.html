        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>This recipe is as delicious as it is simple. It's a 3-ingredient no fuss, no muss delight! A wonderful pairing for ice creams, cakes, puddings, and <em>so much more</em>,
        you'll wonder where it's been your whole life!</p>

        <p>Whipped topping is so versatile and takes on <strong><em>any</em></strong> flavoring you add to it, so it's completely customizable! Just swap in your favorite extract(s). You do <em>you</em>!</p>
    
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pint (2 cups) heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp extract of choice (I use 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>(Optional) Chill the mixing bowl. Place the mixing bowl in the fridge to come down to temperature. While this step isn't required per se,
                it can help your whipped topping stay stable for longer.</li>
            <li>Add all of the ingredients into a mixing bowl. A stand mixer makes this process fool proof, but a hand mixer can also do the trick!</li>
            <li>Beat the mixture on a <em>low</em> speed until the powdered sugar is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Gradually increase the speed to high.</li>
            <li>Once soft peaks begin to form, stop the mixer, and scrape down the sides.</li>
            <li>Continue mixing until the desired consistency is reached, but be careful to not over mix! This <em>will</em> turn your beautiful whipped topping
                into a lumpy butter!</li>
        </ol>
