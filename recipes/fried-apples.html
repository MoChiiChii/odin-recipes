        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>These delectably sweet apples are a wonderful treat. Soft, gooey, cinnamon-y, wonders, they are perfect on their own, as a filling in a pie, adorning a
            pastry, topping your favorite ice cream, or, my personal favorite, stacked on top of fresh made pancakes. They are fresh and fragrant in the summer,
            yet warm and comforting in the winter. These fried apples certainly <em>don't</em> disappoint!</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 apples, sliced thin(can be any variety, but I prefer Fuji or Honeycrisp apples)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp corn starch</li>
        </ul>
