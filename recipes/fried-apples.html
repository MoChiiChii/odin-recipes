        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>These delectably sweet apples are a wonderful treat. Soft, gooey, cinnamon-y, wonders, they are perfect on their own, as a filling in a pie, adorning a
            pastry, topping your favorite ice cream, or, my personal favorite, stacked on top of fresh made pancakes. They are fresh and fragrant in the summer,
            yet warm and comforting in the winter. These fried apples certainly <em>don't</em> disappoint!</p>
